For SMS using google voice to work, the user's ~/.gvoice must be configured.
This has only been tested using UNIX systems, but Win32 should work too.

The only required parts are the email= and password= keys in the [auth] section.
Since we want to send notices automatically, it's recommended that
two-factor authentication for the google voice account be switched
off.
