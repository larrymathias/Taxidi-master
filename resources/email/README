Files in this directory are used as email templates.  Templates are defined
by their own .conf files in this directory.  Resources should, but are not
required to be in their own directory.  Each message is in it's own 
configuration section, and Taxidi currently supports the following:
	- [register]
	- [visitor]
	- [checkin]
	- [checkout]
	
Each section supports the following keys:
	- subject = #Message subject string
	- from = #Common name to use in from field.
	- text = #The message to send for plain text recipients
	- html = #The HTML email template
	- images = #Comma seperated list of images to attach.
	
The CID of each attached image will be interpreted by the file's base name
(billy.jpg -> cid:<billy>). (Note that it takes the CID from the string part before the first dot, so the file 'billy.davis.jpg' will just become 'billy'.)
Most software clients will load images attached in this way, but almost all
webmail systems will prefer images loaded from an URL.

Relevant configuration sections in config.ini:
[report][[email]] to, from, host, TLS, user, pass

Text replacements for checkin/checkout include:
{name}
{lastname}
{guardian} 
{code}
{phone}
