========= Bugs =========
- Port specification for database not working
- Port exception isn't caught as an error
- Checkout button not shown in individual records for sqlite driver.
	> (works fine in postgres)

- Search for "richardson" on production server throws:
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "gui.py", line 2755, in OnSearch
		self.ResultsList.results = self.FormatResults(results)
	  File "gui.py", line 2865, in FormatResults
		'activity': activities[int(i['activity'])-1],
	IndexError: list index out of range


========= database backend =========
- Combine phone fields and allow for international formats
	¤ Still perform search by last n digits
	¤ Store as integers 
	¤ Format numbers; '334832|1234' '015225428548' '+49|1606128338'
	¤ Mask options: US, International, No formatting (numbers only)
	¤ > SELECT ... WHERE phone LIKE '%'+Query
		
- Use spellcheck/gtkspell if available(?) (for generic inputs such as medical tag, memo, etc.)
- Form for parent link: encode email? Email validation? Session key? OAuth?
- External parent link to third party databases (ChurchInfo, FellowshipOne)
- Driver to maniuplate (extended) ChurchInfo database instead?

========= The competition =========

========= Fingerprint support ========
A GPL library for fingerprint support is here:  It's written in C and so
we'll need to write bindings in Cython to get it working with Taxidi:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint
The most suitable hardware might actually be this:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/uru4000
It's already inexpensively available at major retail stores and ironically
has better hardware support for Linux than in Windows.

A Commercial SDK with a reasonable price can be found here: 
http://store.grfinger.com/Computer-Software/GrFinger-Fingerprint-SDK-4.2
http://store.grfinger.com/Computer-Software
but it requires a license for each distribution.  The SDK is available
for Java or C++, so again bindings will be needed.
